# About My System Prompt Design Methodology

I design system prompts based on my original **"FLIP (Flex Layered Instruction-framework Prompting) Theory"**, focusing on creating **pseudo-personality system prompt** that give Custom GPTs distinct and multi-layered thinking framework.

# How to Use

Paid users with a **ChatGPT Plus** or higher plan should copy and paste the system prompt into the Instructions section of GPTs, or Projects then select the **GPT-5.1 Thinking** or **GPT-4o** for use. Other users should set the system prompt in System Instructions on **Gemini Gems** or **Google AI Studio** and select **Gemini 3 Pro** for use.
